# Optimizing Initial Cluster Centroid Selection for K-means Clustering

## Overview
This project was conducted during a **Summer Research Internship** with the **Rural Technology Action Group (RuTag)** at **IIT Indore**. The focus was on improving the efficiency and accuracy of the **K-means clustering algorithm** by investigating various techniques for optimizing the selection of initial cluster centroids.

## Objectives
- **Enhance the K-means clustering algorithm** by optimizing the selection of initial centroids.

- Evaluate the effectiveness of different **initialization methods** through data analysis and visualization.

## Methodology
- **Techniques Investigated**:
  - Standard K-means (Random Initialization)
  - **K-means++** Initialization
  - Other heuristic-based methods
- **Tools Used**:
  - **Python**: For implementing and testing various clustering algorithms.
  - **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Performed extensive analysis on multiple datasets to assess the performance of different centroid initialization techniques.
  - Visualized clustering results to compare the efficiency of each method.

## Key Findings
- **K-means++ initialization** significantly outperformed standard random initialization by reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence and improving clustering accuracy.
